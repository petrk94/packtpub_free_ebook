# packtpub free ebook Python checker

This small script read the title of the current free ebook from packt publishing.
It read the html content into a variable and extract the necessary headline of the title, because the this is still
containing html code and white spaces, it get stripped and only the content inside the html-tags is visible and will 
be displayed in your commandline/shell.

I would be glad if you can save my name in your script code in the comments as first developer, but this is not a MUST ;)
